      <header>Creating my personal webpage</header>
         <p>As I created this webpage, I have learnt how to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code to edit my HTML and CSS scripts, I also used Github to upload my webpage.
            I have also understood the benefits of creating a personal webpage as it is an 'online' portfolio, which is easy for the student to update or edit and
            for the interviewer to look through.</p>
            <img src="Images/Github.png" width="900" height="400">
         <p>The experience I had when i created this webpage is rather enjoyable as seeing it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment.
            It may be difficult at first as I am new to creating a website but through the learning materials provided by the lecturers, I have learnt how to decorate my webpage with a CSS script, 
            upload images and content in my HTML script.</p>
         <p>This are the images of the process in creating my own personal webpage, which are mainly images of my coding.</p>

      <header>3D Design & Printing</header>
      <p>During the first hands-on-session on the 29th & 30th of March,
         I have used Fusion360 to create 5 different designs which I have done together with my groupmates and the help of my lecturers.</p>
      <p>The 1st design is Exercise 3</p>
      <img src="Images/Exercise 3 Tb.png" width="400" height="400"><img src="Images/Exercise3.png" width="700" height="500">

      <p>The 2nd design is Exercise 5</p>
      <img src="Images/Exercise 5 Tb.png" width="400" height="400"><img src="Images/Exercise5.png" width="700" height="500">

      <p>The 3rd design is a chess piece</p>
      <img src="" width="" height=""><img src="Images/Chess piece.png" width="700" height="500">
      
      <p>The 4th design is a Keychain with my name engraved on it. During the hands-on-session,
         I actually got the chance to 3D print my keychain through the use of an app, Ultimaker Cura ver 4.8.0, as well as learning how to use it for future projects.</p>

      <p>The last design is a box which is supposed to be cut out from wood using the 2D laser cutter unlike the other 4 designs which is created through the 3D printer.</p>
